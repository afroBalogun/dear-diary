                <p>Hey there, I'm Temiloluwa Obasa or like I love to call myself Afro Balogun.
                    I'm a Nigerian, born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria.
                    I'm a passionate writer with a love for fiction, poetry, and content writing.
                    My work is characterized by vivid imagery and other times, in depth research.
                    I draw inspiration from everyday life, and my personal experiences.
                    I'm a creative soul with a love for art, music, and words.
                    
                    When I'm not writing, you can find me taking a walk, reading some novel / manga,
                    watching animes,or designing websites.
