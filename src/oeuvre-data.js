        piece_content: "Currently filled up with so much emotions. It’s messed up this feeling of longing and unsurety that makes me compelled to doubt the reality of my existence.. this must be what being a teenager is all about.. Losing yourself of all truths that have been given or heard and discovering your personal truth like a speck of dust sailing these starry skies, it’s nothing out of the ordinary because there are currently a billion other specks of dusts racing through this timeline, it’s all messed up how even before I was fertilized into existence, I was still running, running in a competition so fierce that my consciousness and entirety could’ve been erased… I need to stop, I can’t breathe, I can’t hold on anymore, Life is beautiful but I feel like a stain in it. Why? Why me? Is it just me though? Are there others like me out there?If yes, then I feel safe, I guess it’s not lonely anymore, I can’t feel my sadness. My tears are squirming I’ll hold on for a little while longer, who knows? The answer might not be around me,  but within.."

        piece_content: "Let me tell you a story about death and all its minions, Many enough to consummate the world, but cursed to never satisfy its greed. It finds delight in the works of men, seeing them give their lives to a futile end, It receives sorrow from The Good News, knowing well it struggles, forever, to a scripted epilogue. It does not know of the hope it feeds on, as a predator cares not for prey, It does not illuminate, for in darkness, it finds way. Some tell of gifts to foresee it a while away, others, tales of a stench so pungent, its presence, grave. It thought itself a place of rest, Valhalla, an Elysium for life to come, Oh death, cheated forever, pray tell, Do you find joy in your creator’s assignment? Or do you consider yourself empty, like all the rest, whom He deemed no will to bless."
